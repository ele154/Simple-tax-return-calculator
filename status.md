#### Project title
Simple-tax-return-calculator


#### What have you done for your project so far?
Currently, the project is able to calculate tax and taxable income based on the user's salary and marital status for 2025. I have assigned the 2025 standard deductions to the corresponding marital statuses.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
However, the project is still missing an option for allowing users to enter their capital gains. Additionally, it does not yet transform the calculated data into official tax forms (e.g., Form 1040, W-2, 1099, etc.).


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Transforming the data will be the most difficult part, as every calculated value needs to be mapped to the correct field on the forms.
