# My additional thought 
# I really enjoyed this project. However, I am not satisfied with the final product that I submitted today because the most important step—importing the output to the tax form—is incomplete. I spent three days trying to fix it, but the outputs were either missing or placed in the wrong section. As a result, I have no choice but to withdraw the submission. It was still a fun experience. Unfortunately, due to the length of my code and the video's 3-minute limit, I cannot fully share my thoughts on this project or the challenges I encountered."
# I was sick with a sore throat during the recording. I apologize if any parts of my walkthrough were unclear as a result.
