# Simple-tax-return-calculator
# My additional thought 
# I am really enjoying this project. I am not satisfied with the final product that I submitted today, because the most important step for importing the output to the tax form is not complete. I have been trying it for three days, but the outputs are either missing or placed in the wrong section. As a result, I have no choice but to withdraw the plan. It was a fun experience. However, due to the length of my code and the video's 3-minute duration, I cannot fully share my thoughts on this project and the experience or struggles I encountered during it.
# I was sick and had a sore throat during the recording. I apologize for any unclear instructions in my code.
