# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Simple tax return calculator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The result will provide an approximate estimate of the user’s tax expense (or tax refund) based on the income entered.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will ask users for their name, income, and residency as essential information. The name will appear in and be used for the final report. The income will be used to calculate taxable or non-taxable income. Residency will determine whether the user is eligible for a standard deduction. The system will then determine the applicable tax rate, calculate the total income, and generate the final report. During the income section, the system will also ask how much of the user’s income comes from capital gains and salary, since these are taxed at different rates. Finally, the system will display the results, such as whether the user does not need to pay any tax, owes a certain tax amount, or is eligible for a tax refund.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

 I have no the other final project relate to this one. However, I combine the final project with a course I take before,it called Federal Taxes on Income.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None
## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The project should be able to display the user’s tax expense, refund amount, or indicate that the user does not owe any tax.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The project should be able to display the user’s tax expense, refund amount, or indicate that the user does not owe any tax, and shows the effective tax rate. Finally, it should allow users to enter their capital gains for a more accurate tax calculation.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The project should be able to display the user’s tax expense, refund amount, or indicate that the user does not owe any tax, and shows the effective tax rate. In addition, it should allow users to enter their capital gains for a more accurate tax calculation. Finally. it should also inform the user which tax form they need to fill out.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to review more tax rules before actually starting this project. Furthermore, I will also need to review the if-else and while statements to set different conditions for the tax calculations. Before submitting my final project, I will demo it first to ensure the code runs without any issues. Finally, I will double-check whether the tax rates or deductions I am using are outdated.
